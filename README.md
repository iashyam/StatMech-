1. **Event Driven Collisions**

1. **Arrow of time in the flea universe:**
Two flea infested dogs are lying next to each other. The fleas hop from one dog to the other. Each flea has a name. The dynamics of the fleas is determined by a flea God who loves to play dice with this flea universe. It generates a random number, after a certain time step, between  1  and  𝑁  (where  𝑁  is the number of fleas). Depending on the number, It calls out the name of the corresponding flea, which is compelled to jump from the current dog it is inhabiting to the other. Starting with a given distribution of fleas, these ‘stochastic’ dynamics will evolve the microstate (a precise description of which flea infests which dog) and the macrostate (how many fleas on a given dog).
